    <p id="pink">I tried 8 different root beer brands and chose the best ones!</p>

    <article class="one">
        <h3>3rd PLACE: Virgil's</h3>
        <p>Price: $7.99 for a 4 pack ($2 per 12 oz bottle)<p>
        <p>Taste: 3/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This brand was very rooty, and had prominent licorice notes. It was a little too sweet for me, but the sweetness blended well with the creaminess and licorice taste. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Carbonation: 1/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There was very light carbonation in this drink. When I poured it into a cup, the carbonation was audible, which made me excited to try it, but it ended up not having much carbonation at all, which was disappointing. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Packaging: 2/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The label reminds me of Angry Orchard’s packaging. There are super small details that you have to make out on the bottle, which is fun to look at, but I think that something bigger would be more appealing to buyers. </li>
        </ul>

    <article id="two">
        <h3>2nd PLACE: Route 66</h3>
        <p>Price: $2.49 per bottle<p>
        <p>Taste: 3/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When I poured each root beer into a cup, this was the only one that foamed up, which definitely added to the tasting experience. It was much more creamy than the others, but it still had that “rooty” taste even though it was less sweet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Carbonation: 2/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It could definitely use more carbonation, but the lack of carbonation did not turn me away from the fact that it tasted good.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Packaging: 2/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the packaging, because I believe that it could be more fun, but there’s nothing wrong with a classic “Route 66” branding, I just wish the 6s were closer together. </li>
        </ul>

    <article class="one">
        <h3>1st PLACE: Bawls</h3>
        <p>Price: $2.89 per bottle<p>
        <ul>
            <li>Just a couple of cents more than all the other bottles that I purchased, but definitely worth it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taste: 4/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I definitely believed that this was the best tasting root beer by far. It had more of a classic “root beer” taste. It had notes of licorice that were not overpowering as many of the other root beers were. Also, unlike the other brands, this one tasted very fresh, almost as if it was just poured from a soda fountain rather than from a bottle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Carbonation: 3/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I honestly like a lot of carbonation in my soda, and this was not enough carbonation for me. It was probably the only brand with the most amount of carbonation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Packaging: 5/5</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I fell in love with this bottle in the store! There are bumps around the sides of the distinctly shaped bottle. This bottle mixed with their minimalistic logo creates the perfect pair. </li>
        </ul>

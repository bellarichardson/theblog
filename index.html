        <p class="yellow">Welcome to The Bottle Blog! My name is Bella, and I make it my mission to rate all bottled sodas. Sometimes it can get overwhelming when deciding what brand to purchase since there are so many options. Thus, I will be rating sodas based on the price, taste, carbonation, and packaging! I complete this process by blind taste testing.  I pour each soda into a cup and rate them solely on their taste and carbonation first without knowing what brand it is. Then, I will look at the packaging a price to finalize my decision.</p>
        <div class="hey">
            <p class="okay"><b>Price:</b> It’s important to know whether something is worth the price when comparing it to something else. So, if you’re in the mood to drop a bit more money on something that you’ve heard is really good, then that’s also important to keep it in mind.</p>
            <p class="okay"><b>Taste:</b> When rating these, I believe that it can be tough to rate the taste objectively. When you’re look through these ratings, just know that I do like sweet stuff, but not when it’s overly sweet. It’s a soda, so it should be sweet enough to where it’s not just pure sugar syrup. </p>

        <div class="hey">
            <p class="okay"><b>Packaging:</b> Sometimes I can’t help but pick something off the shelf that has cute packaging, and sometimes it works out in my favor and it tastes great! But most of the time, it ends up lacking in some way or another unfortunately. Thus, I want to be able to find bottles that will stand out to you on the shelf as well as when you’re drinking it!</p>
            <p class="okay"><b>Carbonation:</b> I believe that the carbonation in a drink always affects the experience for the drinker. A drink that is more flat may end up tasting too sweet, and a drink that is overly bubbly may end up tasting not sweet enough.</p>

        <p id="thanks">Thank you for joining my blog, and I hope I can help you find the better bottle!</p>
